Carraway is a lightweight CMS backend for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Carraway provides
- Web console to edit contents
- Web preview for contents on Gatsby
- REST API for Gatsby to integrate with Carraway

[gatsby-source-carraway](https://github.com/adorechic/gatsby-source-carraway) is a source plugin for Gatsby to integrate with Carraway.

Carraway is required on Gatsby build and contents editting, so you don't have to keep running Carraway process.
